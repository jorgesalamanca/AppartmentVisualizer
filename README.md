# Appartment/flat viewer

*by Jorge Salamanca, December 2014.*

Project designed to explore an appartment in a Google Street View fashion. To accomplish this, a node map is drawn to represent the appartment. Then, 4 picutres in each node are taken (north, east, west, south). Application is initialised at any given node, in any given orientation, and the user is allowed to change orientation or move forward (if a connection between current and next node exists in the current orientation). Item grab and drop is also implemented to show it is easy to add new functionalities.

The screenDumps folder has 5 screen shots of the project working.
